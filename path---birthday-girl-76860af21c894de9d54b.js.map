I came to Makati at around 9:30 PM to avoid getting stuck in traffic. I also have to fight my own demons first, to be able to get there. On my first glance at her face, I knew she's not that happy, maybe because I came late and didn't brought her cake. Can you imagine that? Haha! Good thing I've already given my birthday gift to her which she's wearing. But we all know that cake is very symbolic when it comes to celebrations and I don't have any with me. I know she was mad so I have to make every move right to make her feel good. So we went on a walk and decided to eat near her office. The place is called <a href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/carteldeli/\\\">Cartel</a> and the ambience is nice, I bought sandwich for us and some desserts, we talked a little and I was trying to make her feel good by literally feeding her and it worked!

The place really looks nice but smaller compared to their branch in Cebu.
