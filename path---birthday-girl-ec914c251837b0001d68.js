I came to Makati around 9:30 PM to avoid getting stuck on traffic, I also have to fight my own demons first, to be able to get there. At first glance at her face I knew she's not happy, I came late and didn't brought a cake. Can you imagine that? Haha! Good thing I already gave my birthday gift to her which she is wearing. We all know that cake is very symbolic when it comes to celebrations and I don't have any on me. I know she was mad so I have to make every move right to make her feel good. So we went for a walk and decided to eat near her office. The place is called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/carteldeli/\">Cartel</a> and the ambience is nice, I bought sandwich for us and some desserts, we talked a little and I was trying to make her feel good by literally feeding her and it works! Haha! It's funny how the magic of sugar works.</p>\n<p>After a while she came back to her office and I waited for her to finish work. Then we walked to <a href=\"https://www.zomato.com/manila/la-vie-parisienne-salcedo-village-makati-city\">La Vie</a> to grab a glass of wine, it was about to close but we still decided to go. The place really looks nice but smaller compared to their branch in Cebu. The Cebu branch is huge. After our wine session we walked all the way to EDSA Ayala to head back home. </p>\n<h2>Message</h2>\n<p>I know that you accomplished a lot and for that I tip my hat to you, Achieving a degree in MBA is not everyone can do. I'm so proud of you. I know all your adversities in life and you still manage to hang on with faith in God. Your hard work finally paid off and you have a title on your name. Pretty soon I'll mess up your name by changing your last name! ;-) </p>\n<p>I just want you to know that I'm always here for you no matter what. We will surely take this world challenges together. Our next adventures awaits. I love you so much and please take care of yourself.</p>\n<p>For my final words I'd like to leave you a quote by Ausonius.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let us never know what old age is.
