I\'ve been blogging since 2010 using <a href="http://www-reviews.blogspot.com/">blogspot</a> and <a href="http://goodanxiety.org/">wordpress</a>. Although all those blogs are now outdated and removed I don\'t want to abandom my passion for writing.</p>\n<p>Ever since I saw <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> I wanted to try it but for some reason didn\'t happen. Maybe because of the fact that it was built on Ruby and I have no knowledge of it. Good thing I found a great tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHHfoINKLELxDch3uJlSapxg">LevelUp Tuts</a> on <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsbyjs</a>. It was a walkthrough, easy to follow and great for beginners. I was intimidated at first because of the technologies used in Gatsbyjs. Besides <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">Reactjs</a> they used <a href="http://graphql.org/">Graphql</a> although new I heard a lot of good feedbacks about it. But since I already have built web apps with react I decided to choose Gatsbyjs.</p>\n<p>All in all I\'m very happy on what I\'ve accomplished. I will be able to create a blog post using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> and host it on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> which is the best part for me. </p>\n<p>Finally, I\'d like to thank to the people behind all these great tools and technologies I mentioned above!</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/my-blog-is-live",title:"My blog is live",date:"September 27, 2017"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
